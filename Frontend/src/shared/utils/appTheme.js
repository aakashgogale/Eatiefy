/**
 * Dark mode is a *user app* preference, not a global one.
 *
 * The toggle lives in the user app's Profile page, but the `dark` class it sets
 * goes on <html>, which every module shares - so turning it on there also
 * darkened the restaurant, delivery and admin panels. Those panels are
 * light-only and have no toggle of their own.
 *
 * The class has to stay on <html> (portalled modals and dialogs render outside
 * the user layout's subtree and would otherwise lose their dark styling), so
 * instead it is applied or removed per route: on for the user app, off
 * everywhere else.
